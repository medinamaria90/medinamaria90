## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

With a background in Financial Analysis, I swapped spreadsheets for code due to my fascination with solving problems and creating solutions.

I freelance and study at 42 Programming School, focusing mainly on back-end development.

Beyond coding, I'm a curious mind and a bit of a geek. I love books, science, and technology. Coding excites me because it offers daily opportunities for growth and problem-solving.
