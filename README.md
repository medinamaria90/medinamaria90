## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work in finance, driven by a passion for both financial models and lines of code. I analyze the profitability of investments, integrating large volumes of data to support decision-making.

On the side, I enjoy programming in Python, JavaScript, or other languages, exploring personal projects that merge logic, creativity, and problem-solving.

Beyond coding, I'm a curious mind and a bit of a geek. I love books, science, and technology. Coding excites me because it offers daily opportunities for growth and problem-solving.
